makeCacheMatrix <- function(x = matrix()) {

}

## The following function calculates the inverse of 'x'- a matrix created with the makeCacheMatrix function.
## It first checks to see if the inverse has already been calculated. If so, it "gets" the inverse from the
## cache and skips computation. Otherwise, it calculates the inverse.

cacheSolve <- function(x, ...) {
        ## Return a matrix that is the inverse of 'x'
}
